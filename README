The output comes in a playlist called Parse2Playlist
Follow instructions in shell and read comments in code!

Remember to insert your information where comments indicate
These variables needs to be changed:
SPOTIPY_CLIENT_ID, SPOTIPY_CLIENT_SECRET, username
To clarify: the id's need to be grabbed from:
https://developer.spotify.com/my-applications/
Max songs added per run is 100. (Spotify API limit)


Usage:
$ python JsonToPlaylist.py 'nameoffile' [offset]

Offset is optional and for when you have a file with over 100 entries which needs several runs.
E.G: First run is 0->99, then you set offset = 100, and it will grab 100->end

File should be Json or txt, formatted like this:
songname, artist
songname, artist
...

Do manual cleanup in working directory after use - it creates some cache!
